Developer log for quarum
========================

----------

Today I want to create a working example of a fit to one spectrum. 

I've copied over powergauss.py from my line_profiles project and am
cleaning it up and doing some refactoring. 


To Do
-----



Use astropy.constants for constants (wavelengths, cc.c_light_cm_s)?

Refactor to specify number of components on a line-by-line basis.
